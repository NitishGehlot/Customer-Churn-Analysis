Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to understand why customers leave (churn) and identify patterns that can help improve customer retention strategies.

🔍 Project Overview
Objective: Analyze customer data to find key factors affecting churn and build predictive models.

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn dataset (includes demographics, account info, and service usage).

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Techniques Used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Visualization of churn patterns

Machine Learning Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

📈 Key Insights
Identified major churn drivers like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

Senior citizens and month-to-month contract holders show higher churn rates.

Customers with tech support or online security tend to stay longer.

💡 Outcome
This analysis helps telecom companies predict customer churn and take proactive actions to retain high-risk customers, thereby improving overall profitability.
